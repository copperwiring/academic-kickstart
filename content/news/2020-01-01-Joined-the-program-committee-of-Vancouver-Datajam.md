[Vancouver Datajam](https://www.vancouverdatajam.ca/) is hackathon-like event of its own type in Vancouver where some of the biggest tech communities of Vancouver including RLadies, PyLadies, SFU Scientific Programming, Women in Machine Learning/Data Science, Women Techmakers come together. Starting Jan, 2020; I have joined the program committee of Vancouver Datajam.
