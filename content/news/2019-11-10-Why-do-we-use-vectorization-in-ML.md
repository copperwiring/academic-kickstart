When we do machine learning, a lot of time, we use vectors to perform any computation. The same thing can be done using the traditional method of loops too. Let's see how.

We will write a small code to take the dot problem of two numbers. For the vectorized method, we'll use numpy library and for non-vectorized method, we'll use the traditional for loop.
