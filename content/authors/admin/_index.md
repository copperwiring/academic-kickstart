I am currently a graduate research assistant at Networked Robotics and Sensing Laboratory under the supervision of [Prof. Shahram Payandeh](https://www.sfu.ca/engineering/faculty-and-staff/faculty/shahram_payandeh.html!) at Simon Fraser University, Canada. My work revolves around intersection of computer vision and machine learning where I address the problem of unsupervised tracking using RGB and depth images using depth image sensors. In past, I have worked with some great research teams in India including Helicopter and VTOL Laboratory, IIT Kanpur (supervised by [Prof. Abhishek](http://www.iitk.ac.in/aero/abhishek/)), Samsung IoT Innovation Lab, IIT Delhi (supervised by [Prof. Brejesh Lall](http://web.iitd.ac.in/~brejesh/)) and Applied Cognitive Science Lab, IIT Mandi (supervised by [Prof. Varun Dutt](http://faculty.iitmandi.ac.in/~varun/)).

I am also currently doing an internship at [UrtheCast](https://www.urthecast.com/) where I am responsible for developing computationally intensive image processing algorithms for large scale satellite data within a cloud-based infrastructure using deep learning.

I am active member of developer community groups of Vancouver where I run [Women in Machine Learning and Data Science meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Vancouver-Women-in-Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science/), [Google Developers Group](https://www.meetup.com/gdg-burnaby/) and [Vancouver OpenCV meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Vancouver-OpenCV-Meetup/). As a strong proponent of tech and diversity, my involvement goes beyond local community work. I am currently one of the the [chairs](https://sites.google.com/view/wicvworkshop-cvpr2020/committee) of [Women in Computer Vision workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/wicvworkshop-cvpr2020/) co-hosted with [CVPR, 2020](http://cvpr2020.thecvf.com/) and was on the [committe](https://wimlworkshop.org/2019/committee/) of the [Women in Machine Learning workshop, 2019](https://wimlworkshop.org/2019/).

If you have questions about my any of work, feel free to reach out to me via email. I'll be happy to chat!
