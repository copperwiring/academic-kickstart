I am currently a graduate research assistant at Networked Robotics and Sensing Laboratory under the supervision of [Prof. Shahram Payandeh](https://www.sfu.ca/engineering/faculty-and-staff/faculty/shahram_payandeh.html) at Simon Fraser University, Canada. My work revolves around intersection of computer vision and machine learning. I am working on problem of semi-supervised tracking using RGB and depth images for a mobile robot. We explore attention-based trackers (deep learning) and correlation filter-based trackers (non-deep learning). Attention-based models provided high accuracy, but offline training is a bottleneck. On the other hand, correlation filter-based trackers provided the ability to learn on the fly at high FPS which suite our purpose, hence form a major part of my research.

 In past, I have been a part of Helicopter and VTOL Laboratory, IIT Kanpur (supervised by [Prof. Abhishek](http://www.iitk.ac.in/aero/abhishek/)), Samsung IoT Innovation Lab, IIT Delhi (supervised by [Prof. Brejesh Lall](http://web.iitd.ac.in/~brejesh/)) and Applied Cognitive Science Lab, IIT Mandi (supervised by [Prof. Varun Dutt](http://faculty.iitmandi.ac.in/~varun/)).

I was lately an intern at [UrtheCast](https://www.urthecast.com/) where I was responsible for developing computationally intensive image processing algorithms for large scale satellite data within a cloud-based infrastructure using deep learning.

Over the course of my work experience, I have developed excellent skills in PyTorch, TensorFlow, Python, MATLAB, Numpy, Scipy, OpenCV, Matplotlib, GDAL, etc. scientific stack as well as cloud services like AWS.

I am an active member of developer community groups of Vancouver where I run [Women in Machine Learning and Data Science meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Vancouver-Women-in-Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science/), [Google Developers Group](https://www.meetup.com/gdg-burnaby/) and [Vancouver OpenCV meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Vancouver-OpenCV-Meetup/). As a strong proponent of tech and diversity, my involvement goes beyond local community work. In past, I have been one of the the [chairs](https://sites.google.com/view/wicvworkshop-cvpr2020/committee) of [Women in Computer Vision workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/wicvworkshop-cvpr2020/) co-hosted with [CVPR, 2020](http://cvpr2020.thecvf.com/) and was on the [committe](https://wimlworkshop.org/2019/committee/) of the [Women in Machine Learning workshop, 2019](https://wimlworkshop.org/2019/). I am currently an advisor for the Women in Computer Vision workshop to be co-hosted with [CVPR, 2021](http://cvpr2021.thecvf.com/).

If you have questions about any of my work, feel free to reach out to me via email. I'll be happy to chat!
