abstract: In this book chapter, we propose the design and development of a low-cost IoT framework formonitoring landslide is discussed. This framework involved the use of MEMS-based sensors for monitoring landslides at the lab scale. The proposed frame-work can monitor soil moisture and movement and generate alerts based onpredefined thresholds.
